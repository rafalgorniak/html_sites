                    The speed of light in vacuum, denoted c, is a physical constant that is exactly equal to 299,
                    792,458 metres per second (approximately 186,282 miles per second, or one foot per nanosecond).
                     According to standard modern physics, visible light and all other electromagnetic radiation 
                     moves at this.

                    Ole Rømer first demonstrated in 1676 that light does not travel instantaneously by studying the
                     apparent motion of Jupiter's moon Io (diagram shown). In an 1865 paper, James Clerk Maxwell 
                     proposed that light.

                    The double-barred finch (Stizoptera bichenovii) is a species of estrildid finch found in dry
                     savann
                     a, tropical (lowland) dry grassland, and shrubland habitats in northern and eastern Australia.
                      It is sometimes referred to as Bicheno's finch or the owl finch, the latter owing to the dark
                       ring of feathers around the face. This double-barred finch perching on a branch was
                        photographed in Glen Davis, New South Wales.

                    The 2022 National Arena League season was the fifth and most recent season of the National
                     Arena League (NAL).[1] The league played with only six teams from around the Eastern United
                      States area, with one new team arriving from the American Arena League, which were the San
                       Antonio Gunslingers.[2] The season ended with the Albany Empire, Carolina Cobras, Columbus
                        Lions, and Jacksonville Sharks all going into the playoffs.
